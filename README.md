JOEY-M - CU Spaceflight
====================

Joey-M is an experimental flight computer produced as part of the Wombat flight
computer project at Cambridge University Spaceflight.  

It uses a twin varactor crystal pulling arrangement to change the transmit
frequency of a Micrel MICRF112YMM 434MHz ISM band transmitter, along with a dual
16 bit DAC from Linear Technology to control the varactor bias voltage.  

Other equipment on board is a uBlox NEO-6Q GPS, TMP102 12 bit temperature
sensor, and an Atmel ATMEGA328P MCU.  

Designed and released into the public domain by Jon Sowman - March 2012.
